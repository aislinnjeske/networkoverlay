# Using Dijkstra’s Shortest Paths to Route Packets in a Network Overlay

The objective of this assignment is to get you familiar with coding in a distributed setting where you need to 
manage the underlying communications between nodes. This project constructs a logical overlay over 
a distributed set of nodes, and then computes shortest paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm to route packets in the system.


**This is the first assignment for CS455: Introduction to Distributed Systems at Colorado State University**
